# README.md

Edit this page in Markdown, so it looks identical to this image; ![](README.png). Be sure to do the following:
1. Change *My Name* to your name.
2. Remove this instructional content.
3. Match the heading levels:
    * **README**.md is H1
    * **Questions...** and **Homework...** are H2
4. The table is created using a markdown table:
    * **Week** numbers are right-justified
    * **Assignments** are centered
    * **Comments** are left-justified
5. The entry for each week in the column **Assignment** is a hyperlink to the assignment file

Additional work which must be performed:
1. You must have a github.com account (*duh*)
2. To make your life easier, add your public key, so you have *SSH* access. To ensure you have it, I want to see **an image on this page** of you using `SSH -T git@github.com`, this will confirm you have SSH access. It needs to look like this: ![](ssh.png)
3. You must clone this repository to your computer (school or personal). This repository will be where you turn in your homework.
4. Once cloned and changes made, you will need to `stage -> commit -> push`, so I will be able to review your work.
5. Add me as a collaborator and **keep your repository private.**
